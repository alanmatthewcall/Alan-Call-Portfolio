    <h2>
      <p>I recently moved to the city of <span class="pgh">Pittsburgh</span> with my wife and daughter. Something about this place has always been intriguing since I were a kid. The first time I got to visit and see the skyline as well as meet people, I knew this was a place I never wanted to leave. The skyline and great people in <span class="pgh">Pittsburgh</span> aren't the only things that attracted me here though. Oppurtunity is what I am after.

      <p>In December of 2020 I enrolled in a coding bootcamp at Epicodus. So far it has gone great! I have really enjoyed what I have learned and the people that I have met so far! Once bootcamp is over I can't wait to hit the ground running, and to look for my first job in tech. In my favorite city of course.
